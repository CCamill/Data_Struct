Huffman tree and Huffman coding (with complete C language code).Huffman tree, also known as optimal binary tree. In a binary tree with a given n weighted leaf nodes, WPL is the smallest tree. Among them, the weight of the node refers to the value of a specific meaning; the path length from the root to the node multiplied by the node weight; the weighted path length (WPL) of the tree refers to all the nodes in the tree
